## Identify and counter stress in your daily life
This project focuses on the identification of stress causing events during the day and proposition of controlling that stress.

## Goal of the project
Main goal being to help the user improve their mental health by allowing them to monitor, track, and analyze their stress levels by measuring their skin conductance using the signal produced by an epidermal activity sensor. With this project we want to grant the user the ability to visually see their stress, and even pinpoint the occurrence of a stressful event down to the minute.

## Concept
The created concept is based on a microcontroller LPC1786 which collects data through Mikroe-28600 epidermal sensor. Sensor is collecting sweat glands information and the data is sent to the computer to process it on MATLAB. The processed data is shown to the user with highlighted areas where stress triggering event occured.
